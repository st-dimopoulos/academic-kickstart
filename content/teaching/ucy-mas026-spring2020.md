Mathematics for Engineers II is a course offered to the students of the three Engineering Departments of the University of Cyprus. Its content is that of a multivariable calculus course, namely vectors in n-dimensional spaces, limits and continuity of multivariable functions, differentiability and extrema, multiple integrals, line and surface intergrals, fundamental theorems of vector calculus (Green, Stokes, Gauss).

The content for the course can be found (in greek) [here]({{< relref "ucy-mas026-spring2022.md" >}}).
